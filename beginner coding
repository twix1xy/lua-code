---------------
Printing

You can use printing for making sure your code either works. You can use it so you can make sure that the code works well and nothing fails.
EXAMPLE:

function testing()
  local vNum = 10
  local vNum2 = 200
  print(vNum + vNum2)
  print("Both variables are working!")
end

testing() <-- This is what you use to run a function so it doesn't look boring the way you see it. If you don't include this then, your function wont work.
